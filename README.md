# A code outline viewer for GitHub
This is a Chrome extension that augments GitHub code viwer with an overview of the code structure. The ultimate goal of this extension is to display something like the sidebar of [Tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar) in your browser when you are viewing source codes in GitHub. This extension is derived from another [project](https://github.com/ericpony/highlight.js) of mine, and is still at an early stage of development. Please feel free to fork this project, or just tell me there is already a similar project around!
